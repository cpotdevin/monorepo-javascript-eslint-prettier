# JavaScript Monorepo with Eslint and Prettier

This is a JavaScript Monorepo with shared workspaces in the `packages` directory. The `eslint-config` workspace defines a base eslint confg file that is extended by the other eslint configs in other workspaces. Similarly, the `prettier-config` workspace defines a base prettier config file that is extended by other prettier configs in other workspaces.
